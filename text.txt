## ANIMATION LIBRARIES USED

1. **Framer Motion**: For React-based animations (project cards)

3. **JavaScript RequestAnimationFrame**: For custom particle systems and scrolling
4. **CSS Transitions**: For button hover effects and smooth state changes
5. **SVG Filters**: For gooey button effects

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

- Most animations use GPU-accelerated transforms (translate3d, scale)
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animations
- Debounced mouse events for performance
- Lazy loading for images
- CSS will-change property for optimized rendering
